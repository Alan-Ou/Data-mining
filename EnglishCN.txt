<p> National Anthem </p>
<p> Updated: Feb 9, 2021 15:56 PM </p>
<p> The National Anthem was written in 1935, with lyrics by the noted poet Tian Han and music by the famous composer Nie Er. The lyrics are as follows: </p>
<p> Arise, we who refuse to be slaves! </p>
<p> With our very flesh and blood, </p>
<p> Let us build our new Great Wall! </p>
<p> The peoples of China are at their most critical time, </p>

<p> This song, originally named March of the Volunteers, was the theme song of the film, Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm. The film tells the story of those who went to the front to fight the Japanese invaders in Northeast China in the 1930s. </p>
<p> Moving and powerful, the March of the Volunteers gave voice to the Chinese people’s determination to sacrifice themselves for national liberation, and expressed China’s admirable tradition of courage, resolution and unity in fighting foreign aggression. It was for this reason that the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) decided to adopt the song as the provisional national anthem of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on Sept 27, 1949, and the National People’s Congress (NPC) officially decided to adopt the song as the National Anthem of the PRC on Dec 4, 1982. </p>

<p> The CPC: Why and How It Works in China? </p>
<p> By: Xie ChuntaoFrom:English Edition of QiuShi Journal April-June 2019|Vol.11,No.2,Issue No.39 | Updated: 2019-Sep-17 10:42 </p>
<p> The Communist Party of China was founded 98 years ago, and has now governed the country for 70 years. Over this period, the Chinese nation has made the impressive leap from standing up and becoming prosperous to growing strong, thus bringing forth the “China miracle” that has astonished the world. It is not by chance that the CPC has been able to lead the people toward such tremendous success; the Party is equipped with qualities that made certain it was up to the task. </p>
<p> 1. It has lofty ideals and aspirations. </p>
<p> Every political party has aspirations, but the aspirations of each party can be very different from each other. While many political parties scramble for power and profit in service to their respective groups, the CPC represents the interests of the broadest possible majority of the Chinese people. </p>
<p> In the century before the founding of the CPC in 1921, China was a backward and beleaguered country stuck in a state of poverty and weakness. Many people of high ideals searched tirelessly for a way out of this predicament, but none succeeded. From its founding, the CPC assumed the historic mission of saving the Chinese nation from its miserable state and bringing about its grand rejuvenation. In the 28 years that followed, the CPC led the Chinese people through bitter and bloody struggle, overturning the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism and establishing the People’s Republic of China. This allowed the Chinese people to finally stand up. Socialism was later established as China’s basic system, which represented the greatest and most profound social transformation in Chinese history. </p>
<p> Since reform and opening up which began in the late 1970s, the Chinese people have captured great achievements in national development under the leadership of the CPC. At present, China is firmly positioned as the world’s second largest economy, the Chinese people have become better-off and reached a moderately prosperous standard of living overall, and considerable advances have been made in building democracy and the rule of law. China has completed, in the space of mere decades, the process of industrialization that took developed countries several centuries, bringing about a miracle in the history of world development. </p>
<p> There is nothing more convincing than historical fact. Over the past century, the CPC has made enormous contributions to the country, the nation, and the people while always remaining committed to its lofty ideals and aspirations. It is clear why the Chinese people have chosen to follow the CPC. No matter how much the environment changes or how grave the challenges that lay ahead, the CPC will remain true to its original aspirations and devoted to its mission. </p>
<p> 2. It has the guidance of well-founded theories. </p>
<p> The development of concepts and theories is crucial for a political party. Within the party, concepts and theories are used to guide members, telling them how to take action and what the reasons are for doing so. In relation to the public, they are used to inspire the people to follow the party and pool together boundless strength in the process. The CPC attaches great importance to theoretical innovation, and is committed to using innovative theories to sharpen the minds of Party officials and unite the people. </p>
<p> From the day of its founding, the CPC made Marxism its guiding ideology. With Mao Zedong as their chief representative, Chinese Communists combined the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism with the actual practice of the Chinese revolution and created Mao Zedong Thought, under which the New Democratic Revolution was completed, the PRC was founded, socialism was established as the country’s basic system, and much progress was achieved in socialist economic, political, and cultural development. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in 1978, Chinese Communists, with Deng Xiaoping as their chief representative, developed Deng Xiaoping Theory. This offered effective answers to a series of fundamental questions on building Chinese socialism, and thus successfully opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee in 1989, Chinese Communists, with Jiang Zemin as their chief representative, developed the Theory of Three Represents, which successfully launched China’s socialism into the 21st century. After its 16th National Congress in 2002, Chinese Communists, with Hu Jintao as their chief representative, developed the Scientific Outlook on Development, thus successfully upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics from a new and historic point of departure. Since its 18th National Congress in 2012, Chinese Communists, with Xi Jinping as their chief representative, have integrated theory with practice to systematically address the major questions of our times, which are what kind of Chinese socialism should be upheld and developed in the new era and how we should go about doing this, thereby giving shape to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and ushering in a new phase for Chinese socialism. </p>
<p> By contrast, one of the main reasons why communist parties in the former Eastern Bloc collapsed one after the other is that they suffered from protracted ideological stagnation. Their theories were unable to evolve in step with the times, and therefore could not guide new initiatives or even explain contemporary realities. </p>
<p> 3. It has mechanisms for selecting and appointing officials on the basis of merit and ability. </p>
<p> The standards and procedures used by a political party to select officials are extremely important, because these directly determine whether or not the party in question can maintain its advanced nature and purity and remain a vital and cohesive organization. The CPC has always attached great importance to making organizational improvements, particularly with regard to strengthening the ranks of Party officials, and has selected and trained cohort after cohort of highly competent leading officials. </p>
<p> Since the day of its founding, the CPC has consistently emphasized its pioneering nature, and imposed strict requirements on admitting new Party members. In recent years, the Party has remained committed to using the recruitment process to limit the number, improve the structure, raise the quality, and exert the roles of Party members. On this basis, the education and assessment of applicants seeking Party membership has become even more rigorous in order to guarantee that members measure up to mandatory standards of quality. </p>
<p> As early as the revolutionary period, the CPC set out the requirements for building the ranks of Party officials, including that it shall select officials on the basis of their merits and not their origins, that it shall choose candidates based on their moral integrity and professional competence, and that it shall resolutely oppose localism and nepotism. These requirements have guaranteed that the Party has flourished and remained united. Since reform and opening up and especially since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, the Party has constantly explored ways to foster, select, and utilize officials more effectively, and relevant systems have steadily improved. General Secretary Xi Jinping stated that good officials must “hold firm convictions, be committed to serving the people, work diligently and pragmatically, have the courage to take on responsibility, and be honest and upright,” and put particular emphasis on the requirement for officials to be loyal, ethical, and responsible. The CPC has established a series of well-founded principles and a full set of systems and mechanisms for the cultivation, selection, utilization, and management of officials. These concepts, principles, and systems, such as selecting officials on the basis of merit and not origin, requiring that they are professionally competent while putting moral integrity above all else, assigning them to positions that suit them and giving them tasks that they are equipped to handle, emphasizing the development of their abilities by incrementally moving them to higher positions according to their performance and giving them the experiences of working in multiple positions, and bringing them to Party schools for training, are playing an increasingly large role in the development of the official ranks, and are receiving growing recognition from other political parties. </p>
<p> 4. It has strict discipline and rules. </p>
<p> As political organizations, political parties generally have their own constitutions, rules, and disciplinary codes. However, parties with rules and disciplinary codes as strict as those of the CPC are rare. The CPC has always taken this subject very seriously; it has not only established a complete disciplinary code and set of rules, but also ensured that they have been rigorously enforced. </p>
<p> From very early on, the CPC put great stress on strengthening discipline within the Party. In 1927, the Fifth National Congress of the CPC made the decision to establish the Central Supervision Commission, which was responsible for supervising discipline within the Party. During the Agrarian Revolutionary War, the CPC introduced the practice of organizing the Party branch on a company basis in order to strengthen the leadership of the Party over the military, and also formulated the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. Starting from the Yan’an period (1935-1948), the Party’s disciplinary code was gradually enriched and refined as the CPC Central Committee drafted and implemented a whole set of rules and disciplinary standards. </p>
<p> Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, Xi Jinping has responded to the loose, lax, and weak enforcement of Party discipline which prevailed for a time by stressing the importance of closely integrating the ideological development and institutional governance of the CPC, and emphasizing that more rigorous discipline is key for strict and comprehensive governance of the Party. The Central Committee with Xi Jinping at the core views the strict enforcement of the Party’s political discipline and rules as being especially important in the effort to clean up the political environment of the CPC. </p>
<p> Since the 18th National Congress, the Central Committee has drafted and revised a long list of important intraparty regulations. These regulations contain strict discipline and rules, and thus offer institutional safeguards for ensuring that the CPC remains the strong leading core of the Chinese socialist cause. </p>
<p> 5. It has the courage to reform itself. </p>
<p> The CPC is not only equipped with the prowess to lead social revolution, but also the courage to reform itself. This has allowed it to form the abilities and mechanisms necessary to purify, improve, and reform itself, ensuring that it can, by its own initiative, rectify any problems that arise within itself. </p>
<p> During the New Democratic Revolution, Chinese Communists with Mao Zedong as their chief representative were successful in correcting various erroneous tendencies within the Party. For example, through the Yan’an Rectification Movement, they completely eliminated dogmatism and instilled the guiding principle of seeking truth from facts in the hearts of all Party members, which helped the Party grow more mature. It was also during this period that the fine practices of criticism and self-criticism took shape, practices which led the entire CPC and the Chinese people to successfully create socialism with Chinese characteristics. Chinese Communists never take a soft stance when it comes to corruption within the Party, and this is an important reflection of the CPC’s courage to reform itself. The CPC severely punished officials who were discovered to be corrupt during both the Agrarian Revolutionary War and the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. The executions of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan in the early days of the PRC are even more well-known examples of this. All of this goes to show that the CPC has zero tolerance for corruption. </p>
<p> Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping at the core has built a deep understanding of problems that exist within the Party. Emphasizing that “it takes a good blacksmith to make good tools,” the Party has resolutely clamped down on misconduct and fought corruption with the determination to both “cage the tigers” and “swat the flies.” The experience that CPC has gained since the 18th National Congress in comprehensively governing itself with strict discipline proves that it has already pioneered a new path for successful self-governance. Just as the CPC is capable of triumphing over its rivals, it also has the ability to resolve problems that exist within itself. </p>
<p> 6. It has strong leadership abilities. </p>
<p> The leadership of the CPC is the most essential attribute and greatest strength of the Chinese socialist system, and the Party is the highest force of political leadership. The CPC has demonstrated its strong leadership abilities throughout the historical process of leading the people toward the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. </p>
<p> China practices a system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC. The CPC is the governing party while other parties participate in the political process under Chinese socialism, and they consult with each other in the interest of national development and public wellbeing. The CPC is committed to acting as the overall leader and coordinator, and encourages people’s congresses, government institutions, political consultation committees, supervisory organs, judicial organs, procuratorial organs, people’s organizations, enterprises, government-affiliated institutions, and social organizations to coordinate their actions and form greater synergy under its leadership. This leadership system boasts distinct advantages in that it can ensure the centralized and unified leadership of the Party, maintain a stable political environment and consistent policies, and muster immense force for carrying out decisions once they have been made. </p>
<p> Moreover, the CPC has exhibited its strong leadership abilities across a variety of fields. Since reform and opening up, under the leadership of the CPC, we have effectively coped with changing situations, faced down floods, overcome earthquakes, and defused crises. This is a full testament to the strength of the socialist system and the strong leadership abilities of the CPC. </p>

<p> Chinese puts in a good word for the English language </p>
<p> Updated: 2013-11-02 00:37 </p>
<p> By JIN ZHU in Beijing and CHEN JIA in San Francisco (China Daily) </p>
<p> Words of Chinese origin are playing a key role in driving the ongoing globalization of English, experts in both languages say. </p>
<p> "The fact that some 300 million Chinese people are now studying or have studied English means the important impact of Chinese on the language can't be denied," said Paul J.J. Payack, president and chief analyst at Global Language Monitor. </p>
<p> The consultancy, based in Austin in the US state of Texas, documents, analyzes and tracks trends in language usage worldwide, with a particular emphasis on English. </p>
<p> It says some 10,000 words are added to the English language annually, with about 1.83 billion people using English as their native, second, business or technical language. </p>
<p> But the global figure was only about 250 million in 1960, with English-speakers mainly located in Britain and its Commonwealth of former colonies, as well as the United States. </p>
<p> "It's estimated that a new English word is created every 98 minutes," Payack said. </p>
<p> "One example of a word used in English that originated from Chinese that has appeared recently is chengguan (city patrol officer). A quick Google search results in nearly a million citations, far in excess of our minimum number of required citations.'' </p>
<p> The Oxford English Dictionary, which waits 10 years before entering a word to ensure it has "staying power", now has about 1,000 words of Chinese origin, such as taikonaut. </p>
<p> In China, taikonaut refers to a person trained by a human spaceflight program to command, pilot, or serve as a spacecraft crew member. </p>
<p> "It's estimated that Chinese, one of the prime drivers of the globalization of the English language, will continue its influence throughout the 21st century," Payack said. </p>
<p> In August, The Wall Street Journal used the term dama, which is Chinese pinyin for "big mother", to describe the middle-aged Chinese women driving the global gold market. </p>
<p> In a video report, it said it is largely because of dama that China can compete with India as the world's largest gold consumer. Many Chinese people saw the use of dama as evidence that the more advanced a country becomes, the more influential its language is. </p>
<p> Wei Chongxin, dean of Beijing Foreign Studies University's School of Chinese Language and Literature, said he believes such influence is rooted in China's growing global clout. </p>
<p> "When more native English speakers come to learn more about China and have closer relations with the country in daily life, it's normal to see the Chinese and English languages infiltrate with each other's words," he said. </p>
<p> The convergence of the main languages of global powers has many precedents in history, including the Greek and Roman conquests and the unification of ancient China. In more recent times, the languages of Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, France and Britain dominated many of the colonies they established from the 16th to 19th centuries, according to GLM. </p>
<p> However, compared with the impact of English on the Chinese language in the past, experts say Chinese still has a limited influence on English. </p>
<p> "One reason for the difficulty in translation between English and Chinese is that they stemmed from entirely different language families," Payack said. </p>
<p> He added that English, with Proto-Indo-European roots has some kinship with Greek, Latin, Celtic, the Romance languages (which include French and Italian), Polish and Russian, and even Kurdish, Farsi and Sanskrit. Meanwhile, Mandarin stems from the Proto-Sino-Tibetan family of languages. </p>
<p> "This makes the contemporary mixing, melding or mash-up of English and Mandarin even more interesting and complex, which is one reason why some 'Chinglish' phrasing strikes outsiders as confusing and even amusing," Payack said. </p>
<p> But Han Baocheng, a language professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said the use of "Chinglish" phrases cannot be regarded as Chinese words having an influence on the English language. </p>
<p> "At present, most of the limited number of new words with Chinese origins that have been regarded as entering the English language are those that cannot find proper words in English to express the original meanings in Chinese," he said. </p>
<p> But Wei Chongxin, who is also a senior professional in cross-cultural communication, said such mixing of the two languages provides Chinese- and English-learners with an opportunity to improve their studies and make them easier. </p>
<p> "Moreover, because the two languages can absorb from each other, both can be more vigorous and have a wider range of users," he said. </p>
<p> Lisa Hoffman graduated from the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing this year and now works at Guinness World Records in the city. </p>
<p> The 24-year-old Canadian can speak Mandarin fluently. </p>
<p> "Since the two languages are completely different, it's really difficult for foreigners, especially those living overseas, to remember Chinese words," she said. </p>
<p> "For instance, my mom, who can't speak any Chinese, has to remember ni hao (hello) by 'knee' and 'how'," she said. "But she can easily say words with Chinese origins, such as baijiu (liqor), as those words frequently appear in her daily life." </p>

<p> Constitution of the People’s Republic of China </p>
<p> Updated: Aug 23,2014 6:08 PM npc.gov.cn </p>
<p> (Full text after amendment on March 14, 2004) </p>
<p> (Adopted at the Fifth Session of the Fifth National People’s Congress and promulgated for implementation by the Announcement of the National People’s Congress on December 4, 1982 </p>
<p> Amended in accordance with the Amendments to the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China adopted respectively at the First Session of the Seventh National People’s Congress on April 12, 1988, the First Session of the Eighth National People’s Congress on March 29, 1993, the Second Session of the Ninth National People’s Congress on March 15, 1999 and the Second Session of the Tenth National People’s Congress on March 14, 2004) </p>
<p> Preamble </p>
<p> China is a country with one of the longest histories in the world. The people of all of China’s nationalities have jointly created a culture of grandeur and have a glorious revolutionary tradition. </p>
<p> After 1840, feudal China was gradually turned into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. The Chinese people waged many successive heroic struggles for national independence and liberation and for democracy and freedom. </p>
<p> Great and earthshaking historical changes have taken place in China in the 20th century. </p>
<p> The Revolution of 1911, led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, abolished the feudal monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of China. But the historic mission of the Chinese people to overthrow imperialism and feudalism remained unaccomplished. </p>
<p> After waging protracted and arduous struggles, armed and otherwise, along a zigzag course, the Chinese people of all nationalities led by the Communist Party of China with Chairman Mao Zedong as its leader ultimately, in 1949, overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism, won a great victory in the New-Democratic Revolution and founded the People’s Republic of China. Since then the Chinese people have taken control of state power and become masters of the country. </p>
<p> After the founding of the People’s Republic, China gradually achieved its transition from a New-Democratic to a socialist society. The socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production has been completed, the system of exploitation of man by man abolished and the socialist system established. The people’s democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, which is in essence the dictatorship of the proletariat, has been consolidated and developed. The Chinese people and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army have defeated imperialist and hegemonist aggression, sabotage and armed provocations and have thereby safeguarded China’s national independence and security and strengthened its national defence. Major successes have been achieved in economic development. An independent and relatively comprehensive socialist system of industry has basically been established. There has been a marked increase in agricultural production. Significant advances have been made in educational, scientific and cultural undertakings, while education in socialist ideology has produced noteworthy results. The life of the people has improved considerably. </p>
<p> The victory in China’s New-Democratic Revolution and the successes in its socialist cause have been achieved by the Chinese people of all nationalities, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, by upholding truth, correcting errors and surmounting numerous difficulties and hardships. China will be in the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come. The basic task of the nation is to concentrate its effort on socialist modernization along the road of Chinese-style socialism. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents, the Chinese people of all nationalities will continue to adhere to the people’s democratic dictatorship and the socialist road, persevere in reform and opening to the outside world, steadily improve socialist institutions, develop the socialist market economy, develop socialist democracy, improve the socialist legal system and work hard and self-reliantly to modernize the country’s industry, agriculture, national defence and science and technology step by step and promote the coordinated development of the material, political and spiritual civilizations, to turn China into a socialist country that is prosperous, powerful, democratic and culturally advanced. </p>
<p> The exploiting classes as such have been abolished in our country. However, class struggle will continue to exist within certain bounds for a long time to come. The Chinese people must fight against those forces and elements, both at home and abroad, that are hostile to China’s socialist system and try to undermine it. </p>
<p> Taiwan is part of the sacred territory of the People’s Republic of China. It is the inviolable duty of all Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan, to accomplish the great task of reunifying the motherland. </p>
<p> In building socialism it is essential to rely on workers, peasants and intellectuals and to unite all forces that can be united. In the long years of revolution and construction, there has been formed under the leadership of the Communist Party of China a broad patriotic united front which is composed of the democratic parties and people’s organizations and which embraces all socialist working people, all builders of socialism, all patriots who support socialism, and all patriots who stand for the reunification of the motherland. This united front will continue to be consolidated and developed. The Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a broadly based representative organization of the united front which has played a significant historical role, will play a still more important role in the country’s political and social life, in promoting friendship with other countries and in the struggle for socialist modernization and for the reunification and unity of the country. The system of the multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist Party of China will exist and develop for a long time to come. </p>
<p> The People’s Republic of China is a unitary multi-national State created jointly by the people of all its nationalities. Socialist relations of equality, unity and mutual assistance have been established among the nationalities and will continue to be strengthened. In the struggle to safeguard the unity of the nationalities, it is necessary to combat big-nation chauvinism, mainly Han chauvinism, and to combat local national chauvinism. The State will do its utmost to promote the common prosperity of all the nationalities. </p>
<p> China’s achievements in revolution and construction are inseparable from the support of the people of the world. The future of China is closely linked to the future of the world. China consistently carries out an independent foreign policy and adheres to the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence in developing diplomatic relations and economic and cultural exchanges with other countries. China consistently opposes imperialism, hegemonism and colonialism, works to strengthen unity with the people of other countries, supports the oppressed nations and the developing countries in their just struggle to win and preserve national independence and develop their national economies, and strives to safeguard world peace and promote the cause of human progress. </p>
<p> This Constitution, in legal form, affirms the achievements of the struggles of the Chinese people of all nationalities and defines the basic system and basic tasks of the State; it is the fundamental law of the State and has supreme legal authority. The people of all nationalities, all State organs, the armed forces, all political parties and public organizations and all enterprises and institutions in the country must take the Constitution as the basic standard of conduct, and they have the duty to uphold the dignity of the Constitution and ensure its implementation. </p>

<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Foreword </p>
<p> Global warming in recent years has accelerated the melting of ice and snow in the Arctic region. As economic globalization and regional integration further develops and deepens, the Arctic is gaining global significance for its rising strategic, economic values and those relating to scientific research, environmental protection, sea passages, and natural resources. The Arctic situation now goes beyond its original inter-Arctic States or regional nature, having a vital bearing on the interests of States outside the region and the interests of the international community as a whole, as well as on the survival, the development, and the shared future for mankind. It is an issue with global implications and international impacts. </p>
<p> A champion for the development of a community with a shared future for mankind, China is an active participant, builder and contributor in Arctic affairs who has spared no efforts to contribute its wisdom to the development of the Arctic region. The Chinese government hereby issues this white paper, to expound its basic positions on Arctic affairs, to elaborate on its policy goals, basic principles and major policies and positions regarding its engagement in Arctic affairs, to guide relevant Chinese government departments and institutions in Arctic-related activities and cooperation, to encourage relevant parties to get better involved in Arctic governance, and to work with the international community to safeguard and promote peace and stability in, and the sustainable development of, the Arctic. </p>
<p> I. The Arctic Situation and Recent Changes </p>
<p> The Arctic is situated at a special geographical location. It commonly refers to the area of land and sea north of the Arctic Circle (approximately 66 degrees 34 minutes N), totaling about 21 million square kilometers. In the context of international law, the Arctic includes the northernmost landmasses of Europe, Asia and North America adjacent to the Arctic Ocean and the relevant islands, and a combination of sea areas within national jurisdiction, high seas, and the Area in the Arctic Ocean. There is no single comprehensive treaty for all Arctic affairs. The Charter of the United Nations, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Spitsbergen Treaty and other treaties and general international law govern Arctic affairs at present. </p>
<p> The continental and insular land territories in the Arctic cover an area of about 8 million square kilometers, with sovereignty over them belonging to Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States, respectively. The Arctic Ocean covers an area of more than 12 million square kilometers, in which coastal States and other States share maritime rights and interests in accordance with international law. These coastal States have within their jurisdiction internal waters, territorial seas, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and continental shelves in the Arctic Ocean. Certain areas of the Arctic Ocean form part of the high seas and the Area. </p>
<p> States from outside the Arctic region do not have territorial sovereignty in the Arctic, but they do have rights in respect of scientific research, navigation, overflight, fishing, laying of submarine cables and pipelines in the high seas and other relevant sea areas in the Arctic Ocean, and rights to resource exploration and exploitation in the Area, pursuant to treaties such as UNCLOS and general international law. In addition, Contracting Parties to the Spitsbergen Treaty enjoy the liberty of access and entry to certain areas of the Arctic, the right under conditions of equality and, in accordance with law, to the exercise and practice of scientific research, production and commercial activities such as hunting, fishing, and mining in these areas. </p>
<p> The Arctic boasts a unique natural environment and rich resources, with most of its sea area covered under thick ice for most of the year. The Arctic natural environment is now undergoing rapid changes. Over the past three decades, temperature has been rising continuously in the Arctic, resulting in diminishing sea ice in summer. Scientists predict that by the middle of this century or even earlier, there may be no ice in the Arctic Ocean for part of the year. On the one hand, melting ice in the Arctic has led to changes in the natural environment, or possibly can result in accelerated global warming, rising sea levels, increased extreme weather events, damaged biodiversity, and other global problems. On the other, with the ice melted, conditions for the development of the Arctic may be gradually changed, offering opportunities for the commercial use of sea routes and development of resources in the region. Commercial activities in the region will have considerable impact on global shipping, international trade and energy supply, bring about major social and economic changes, and exert important influence on the way of work and life of Arctic residents including the indigenous peoples. They may also pose a potential threat to the ecological environment of the Arctic. The international community faces the same threat and shares the same future in addressing global issues concerning the Arctic. </p>
<p> II. China and the Arctic </p>
<p> China is an important stakeholder in Arctic affairs. Geographically, China is a “Near-Arctic State”, one of the continental States that are closest to the Arctic Circle. The natural conditions of the Arctic and their changes have a direct impact on China’s climate system and ecological environment, and, in turn, on its economic interests in agriculture, forestry, fishery, marine industry and other sectors. </p>
<p> China is also closely involved in the trans-regional and global issues in the Arctic, especially in such areas as climate change, environment, scientific research, utilization of shipping routes, resource exploration and exploitation, security, and global governance. These issues are vital to the existence and development of all countries and humanity, and directly affect the interests of non-Arctic States including China. China enjoys the freedom or rights of scientific research, navigation, overflight, fishing, laying of submarine cables and pipelines, and resource exploration and exploitation in the high seas, the Area and other relevant sea areas, and certain special areas in the Arctic Ocean, as stipulated in treaties such as the UNCLOS and the Spitsbergen Treaty, and general international law. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China shoulders the important mission of jointly promoting peace and security in the Arctic. The utilization of sea routes and exploration and development of the resources in the Arctic may have a huge impact on the energy strategy and economic development of China, which is a major trading nation and energy consumer in the world. China’s capital, technology, market, knowledge and experience is expected to play a major role in expanding the network of shipping routes in the Arctic and facilitating the economic and social progress of the coastal States along the routes. China has shared interests with Arctic States and a shared future with the rest of the world in the Arctic. </p>
<p> China has long been involved in Arctic affairs. In 1925, China joined the Spitsbergen Treaty and started to participate in addressing the Arctic affairs. Since then, China has exerted more efforts in the exploration of the Arctic, expanding the scope of activities, gaining more experience and deepening cooperation with other participants. China’s membership in the International Arctic Science Committee in 1996 marked its more active participation in scientific research in the Arctic. Since 1999, China has organized a number of scientific expeditions in the Arctic, with its research vessel Xue Long (Snow Dragon) as the platform. In 2004, China built the Arctic Yellow River Station in Ny Alesund in the Spitsbergen Archipelago. By the end of 2017, China has carried out eight scientific expeditions in the Arctic Ocean, and conducted research for 14 years with the Yellow River Station as the base. Using its research vessel and stations as platforms, China has gradually established a multi-discipline observation system covering the sea, ice and snow, atmosphere, biological, and geological system of the Arctic. The year 2005 saw China as the first Asian country to host the Arctic Science Summit Week, a high-level conference on Arctic affairs. In 2013, China became an accredited observer to the Arctic Council. In recent years, Chinese companies have begun to explore the commercial opportunities associated with Arctic shipping routes. China’s activities in the Arctic have gone beyond mere scientific research, and expanded into diverse areas of Arctic affairs including the platforms of global governance, regional cooperation, and bilateral and multilateral affairs, and such disciplines as scientific research, ecological environment, climate change, economic development, and cultural exchanges. As an important member of the international community, China has played a constructive role in the formulation of Arctic-related international rules and the development of its governance system. The Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road (Belt and Road Initiative), an important cooperation initiative of China, will bring opportunities for parties concerned to jointly build a “Polar Silk Road”, and facilitate connectivity and sustainable economic and social development of the Arctic. </p>
<p> III. China’s Policy Goals and Basic Principles on the Arctic </p>
<p> China’s policy goals on the Arctic are: to understand, protect, develop and participate in the governance of the Arctic, so as to safeguard the common interests of all countries and the international community in the Arctic, and promote sustainable development of the Arctic. </p>

<p> Preamble </p>
<p> China is one of the countries with the longest histories in the world. The Chinese people of all ethnic groups jointly created its magnificent culture and have a proud revolutionary tradition. </p>
<p> After 1840, feudal China gradually became a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country. The Chinese people, wave upon wave, waged heroic struggles for national independence and liberation and for democracy and freedom. </p>
<p> In the 20th century, momentous historical changes took place in China. </p>
<p> The Revolution of 1911, led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, abolished the feudal monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of China. However, the historic mission of the Chinese people to oppose imperialism and feudalism was not yet accomplished. </p>
<p> In 1949, after engaging in protracted, arduous and tortuous struggles, armed and in other forms, the Chinese people of all ethnic groups led by the Communist Party of China with Chairman Mao Zedong as its leader finally overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism, won a great victory in the New Democratic Revolution, and founded the People’s Republic of China. The Chinese people thus secured power and became masters of their own country. </p>
<p> After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, our country gradually achieved the transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society. The socialist transformation of private ownership of the means of production has been completed, the system of exploitation of man by man abolished, and a socialist system established. The people’s democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants, which in essence is a dictatorship of the proletariat, has been consolidated and developed. The Chinese people and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army have defeated imperialist and hegemonist aggression, sabotage and armed provocations, safeguarded national independence and security, and strengthened national defense. Major achievements have been made in economic development. An independent and relatively complete socialist industrial system has now basically been established, and agricultural output has markedly increased. Significant advances have been made in education, science, culture and other fields, and education about socialist thought has made notable progress. The lives of the people have been considerably improved. </p>
<p> Both the victory in China’s New Democratic Revolution and the successes in its socialist cause have been achieved by the Chinese people of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought by upholding truth, correcting errors, and surmounting many difficulties and obstacles. Our country will long remain in the primary stage of socialism. The fundamental task for our country is to concentrate on achieving socialist modernization along the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We the Chinese people of all ethnic groups will continue, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, to uphold the people’s democratic dictatorship, stay on the socialist road, carry out reform and opening up, steadily improve the socialist institutions, develop the socialist market economy and socialist democracy, improve socialist rule of law, apply the new development philosophy, and work hard in a spirit of self-reliance to modernize step by step the country’s industry, agriculture, national defense, and science and technology and promote coordinated material, political, cultural-ethical, social and ecological advancement, in order to build China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful, and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. </p>
<p> In our country the exploiting class, as a class, has been eliminated, but class struggle will continue to exist within a certain scope for a long time to come. The people of China must fight against those domestic and foreign forces and elements that are hostile to and undermine our country’s socialist system. </p>
<p> Taiwan is part of the sacred territory of the People’s Republic of China. It is the sacred duty of all the Chinese people, including our fellow Chinese in Taiwan, to achieve the great reunification of the motherland. </p>
<p> The cause of building socialism must rely on workers, peasants and intellectuals and unite all forces that can be united. Through the long process of revolution, development and reform, a broad patriotic united front has formed under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with the participation of other political parties and people’s organizations and including all socialist working people, people involved in building socialism, patriots who support socialism, and patriots who support China’s reunification and are dedicated to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This united front will continue to be consolidated and developed. The Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference is a broadly representative organization of the united front, and has played a significant historical role. In the future, it will play an even more important role in the country’s political and social life and its friendly foreign activities, in socialist modernization and in safeguarding the unity and solidarity of the country. The system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China will continue and develop long into the future. </p>
<p> The People’s Republic of China is a unified multiethnic state founded by the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. Socialist ethnic relations of equality, unity, mutual assistance and harmony are established and will continue to be strengthened. In the struggle to safeguard ethnic unity, we should oppose major ethnic group chauvinism, which mainly refers to Han chauvinism, and local ethnic chauvinism. The state makes every effort to promote the shared prosperity of all the country’s ethnic groups. </p>
<p> The achievements of China’s revolution, development and reform would have been impossible without the support of the world’s people. The future of China is closely bound up with the future of the world. China pursues an independent foreign policy, observes the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, mutual noninterference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, keeps to a path of peaceful development, follows a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up, works to develop diplomatic relations and economic and cultural exchanges with other countries, and promotes the building of a human community with a shared future. China consistently opposes imperialism, hegemonism and colonialism, works to strengthen its solidarity with the people of all other countries, supports oppressed peoples and other developing countries in their just struggles to win and safeguard their independence and develop their economies, and strives to safeguard world peace and promote the cause of human progress. </p>
<p> This Constitution affirms, in legal form, the achievements of the struggles of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and stipulates the fundamental system and task of the state. It is the fundamental law of the state and has supreme legal force. The people of all ethnic groups, all state organs and armed forces, all political parties and social organizations, and all enterprises and public institutions in the country must treat the Constitution as the fundamental standard of conduct; they have a duty to uphold the sanctity of the Constitution and ensure its compliance. </p>
